See the pom.xml

Its made with IntellijIdea,Cursive clojure plugin,and Maven as build tool.
Clojureapp project is made with IntellijIdea,Cursive clojure plugin,and leiningen as build tool.

(if never used clojure,you can install intellijIdea community edition and cursive plugin,that works both maven and
 leiningen,and later move to your enviroment see also https://www.dunebook.com/best-clojure-ide-and-editors/)

Cursive is easy to use,and works good with Java,has strict parenthensis edit,with ctrl+w we select code etc

Before starting

Save the data in the database
1)go to clojureapp (get the code from github)
2)cd data-test
3)$quick-mongo-atlas-datasets-master/dump$ mongorestore sample_training/.
  (install mongorestore if you dont have it https:docs.mongodb.com/database-tools/installation/installation-linux/)
  (sample data part of the mongod-atlas datasets from https:github.com/huynhsamha/quick-mongo-atlas-datasets)

Install all maven dependencies
cd cmql
lein install
cd cmql-js
lein install
cd clojureapp
lein install

Its 3 steps
1)write the clojure code(decide where,in seperate project or in maven project)
2)write a wrapper to call it (decide where to write the wrapper,in clojure code or in java code)
  wrapper is 2 lines of standard code/per wrapped function
3)call it as a normal static Java method

Write the clojure code,we can write the code in 2 places (1)
1)write the Clojure code in another project with other build tool like leiningen that is the most common one
  lein install
  use the maven local dependency that lein install created in a Maven Java app
  see pom.xml (for the dependency)
2)write the Clojure code inside a Maven application,at the clojure directory
  see pom.xml (to configure srcs directories etc)

Here we used both ways
1)clojure code in clojureapp,that we used as dependency (after we did lein install to it)
2)clojure code in maven project,we used it only as example  clojure/queries/connection has clojure code
  inside the maven project

Wrapping the Clojure code (2)
1)in Clojure code
  Clojure programmer makes a Java class from Clojure,and the java programmer calls them as regular Java methods
2)in Java code
  Java programmers makes a wrapper to use the Clojure methods like normal Java methos

Here we used both ways
1)javaapp/Queries have the wrapper implemented in Java,to call the clojure/queries/connection.
2)inside clojureapp.interop.quickstart_api

Calling the Clojure code (3)
import static javaapp.Queries.*;     we import our Java wrapper,that wraps the Maven clojure
import static clojureapp.interop.Quickstart_api.*;  this is to import our Clojure wrapper,that wraps the the clojureapp
in both cases we import static,and call as a normal Static method

*In the maven project we made the wrapper in Java,we could have made the wrapper in Clojure also inside the Maven project
 but that requires AOT compilation.
